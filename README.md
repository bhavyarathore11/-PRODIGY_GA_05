# PRODIGY_GA_05
The primary goal is to apply the artistic style of one image (such as a famous painting) to the content of another image.
Description
This project demonstrates the application of neural style transfer, where the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) is applied to the content of another image. The technique leverages deep neural networks to blend the content of one image with the style of another, resulting in a new, stylized image.

Features
Content Image Transformation: Maintain the content structure of the original image.
Style Application: Apply the artistic style of a second image.
Image Processing: Utilize image processing techniques to create visually appealing results.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your content image and style image in the images folder.
Run the script to perform neural style transfer:
bash
Copy code
python style_transfer.py --content images/content.jpg --style images/style.jpg --output images/output.jpg
Examples
Here are some examples of the generated images:

Original Content Image:

Style Image:

Output Image:

Code Explanation
The core script style_transfer.py performs the following steps:

Load Images: Load the content and style images using OpenCV.
Preprocess Images: Preprocess the images to fit the model requirements.
Define the Model: Use a pre-trained neural network (e.g., VGG19) to extract features from the content and style images.
Compute Style and Content Representations: Extract and compute the content and style representations.
Optimize the Output Image: Optimize the output image to minimize the content and style loss.
Save and Display Results: Save and display the stylized output image.
